# Getting Started

To get started is to visit [linuxgsm.com](https://linuxgsm.com/servers) and pick a server to install. Follow the simple step-by-step guide to install your game server on Linux.

Once the installation is complete a working game server will be available. Use the various LinuxGSM commands available to manage the game server.
